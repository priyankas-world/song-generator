[Verse]
High up in the Hollywood hills, taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage, don't do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, I've got my dad

[Misc]
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Verse]
High up in the Hollywood hills, crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

[Misc]
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Bridge]
Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Outro]
Hmmmm
Hmmmm
Hmmmm
Hmmmm
