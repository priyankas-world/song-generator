[Verse]
Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, get over here
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, you da bestest, lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play your video game

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do
Hmmm

[Verse]
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do
N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do hmm mmm
Now, you do, N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do
