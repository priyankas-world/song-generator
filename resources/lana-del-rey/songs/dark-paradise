[Verse]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That's how you sang it
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That's how we played it

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
Dead, like you

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

[Verse]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That's why I stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
Dead, like you

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

[Misc]
Oh oh oh oh ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Bridge]
There's no relief
I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me
But I can feel you touching me
There's no release
I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
So tell me
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
