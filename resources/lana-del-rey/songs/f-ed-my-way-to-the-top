[Verse]
Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Verse]
I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me's a fucking bore
To me, but babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me something nice 'bout your favorite girl

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Bridge]
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fuckin' need you, baby, more, more, more, more

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favorite girl

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Outro]
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
I need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Ah, ah
Ah
