[Verse 1]
I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah

[Verse 2]
I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah

[Bridge]
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
