[Verse]
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, you don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, you don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age"
Lying, I'm lying

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah woah
White lightning

[Verse]
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, you don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, you don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day"
It's tiring, tiring

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah woah
White lightning

[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry-knots
Smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Misc]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah woah
White lightning
Like lightning, woah woah
White lightning

[Outro]
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
