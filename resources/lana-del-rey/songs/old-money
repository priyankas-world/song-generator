[Intro]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty

[Verse]
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse]
The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

[Verse]
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and pretty
