[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Being a mistress on the side
Ah, yeah-ah
It might not appeal to fools like you
Ah
Creeping around on the side
Might not be something you would do
Ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
But you haven't seen my man
Man
You haven't seen my man
Man, man
You haven't seen my man
Man
You haven't seen him
Whoa ah

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Verse 2]
Being a bad bitch on the side
Ah, ah
Might not appeal to fools like you
Ah, ah
Creeping around while he gets high
It might not be something you would do
Ah

[Pre-Chorus]
But you haven't seen my man
Man
You haven't seen my man
Man, man
You haven't seen my man
Man
You haven't seen him
Whoa ah

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Bridge]
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
