[Verse]
Are you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer

[Verse]
You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're telling me, what?
I don't know

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

[Misc]
Drinks on the patio

[Verse]
Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

[Verse]
I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go?
Baby, I don't know

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch me again

[Bridge]
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're acting like a big shot

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again
