[Verse]
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

[Verse]
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know
Fuck!

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic a cherry cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
Fuck!

[Verse]
Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in
Fuck!

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic a cherry cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

[Bridge]
We could get high in Miami
Ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami
Ooh, ooh
That's what they all say
Yay

[Misc]
You believe me, don't you baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic a cherry cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Floridians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Colombians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

[Outro]
That's how we do it, like
Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away
