[Intro]
Ta da da da da da da
Pa da da da da da da
Ta da da da da da da

[Verse]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus]
I say
I say

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Ta da da da da da da
Pa da da da da da da
Ta da da da da da da

[Verse]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to sing
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm free
I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge]
I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Chorus]
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Pa da pa pa, pa de da
Te de de, da da ah
Ooh, oh
Woah ah

[Misc]
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Outro]
Pa da da da da da da
Da da da da da, baby
Ah ta da da da da
Da da da da, baby
Pa da da da da da
Pa pa da pa da, yeah
Yeah, yeah
