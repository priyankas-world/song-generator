[Verse]
Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
I said, don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

[Verse]
Whitman is my daddy
Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

[Pre-Chorus]
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
I said, don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

[Bridge]
My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
And go about the world like I'm having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary's swaying softly to her heart's delight

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

[Outro]
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
